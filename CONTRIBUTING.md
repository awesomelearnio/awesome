Before contributing, please take a moment to read the guidelines below to ensure consistency, clarity, and quality across the project.

## What Is Awesome Learn?

**Awesome Learn** provides *structured learning paths* with minimal, curated recommendations.  

Where Awesome Lists curate resources, Awesome Learn focuses on *how to learn* effectively — with guided steps, essential tools, and no unnecessary noise.

- Clear explanations.  
- Minimal but high-quality resources.  
- Logical sequencing.  
- Beginner friendliness.  
- Accurate, up-to-date content.  

## Ways You Can Contribute

### ✔ Add high-quality resources  

Suggested resources must be exceptional and limited: 

- At most **3 books**.  
- At most **3–5 courses or videos**.  
- Always prefer official documentation.  

### ✔ Add practice materials

Coding challenges, exercises, and hands-on projects.

### ✔ Create a new learning path

New topics are welcome if they fit within the mission of Awesome Learn.

Small improvements always help.

## Contribution Guidelines

All new topic submissions must use the [official template](https://github.com/awesomelearnio/learning-path).

This ensures consistency across the entire project.

- No long lists of links.
- No affiliate links.
- Prefer open-source or free resources when possible.

A learning path must be organized from **beginner → intermediate → advanced**, and include:

- Overview.  
- Prerequisites.  
- Step-by-step plan.  
- Essential resources.  
- Practice suggestions.  
- Next steps.  

Do not skip or rearrange sections unless justified.

### 4. **Writing Style**

Please write in a style that is:

- Clear.
- Neutral.

- Professional but not overly academic.

Avoid overly long paragraphs. Keep explanations concise.

### 5. **Link Requirements**

Links must meet the following criteria:

- Use direct URLs (no trackers, no shortened links).
